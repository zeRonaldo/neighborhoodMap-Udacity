# NeighborhoodMap-Udacity

This project was created as part of udacity's nanodegree program for Advanced Front-End Developer. this project is part of the last module the second assignment using react.

This project is bootstrapped with node.js(npm) and the create-react app was used as starter point. you're currently accessing a development version, and it is *not* yet built.

The project uses two API's so it can deliver it's funcionalities, it uses GoogleMaps Javascript Api to fetch the map and mount the markers, the rest of the information comes from FourSquare Api where it fetches 3 different lists with venues.

**Note: the service-worker used is the default CRA, so it only works correctly after the project is built**

## TL;DR

- using your node enabled command line tool access the folder inside this repository main folder
- enter the *'npm install'* command and wait for the installation of dependencies to finish
- enter *'npm start'* command and wait for the server to run
- on your browser access localhost:(port wich the npm started the server)


### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
